We have weekly contact with local weaving ateliers in countries such as Nepal, and it is our duty and responsibility to cooperate only with weaving ateliers who can guarantee us an ethically correct working environment.

Ashtari is fully committed to a fair and reliable trade with the weaving atelier in their land of origin.

For over 30 years, we cooperate with weaving ateliers who meet our ethical values and standards, and who are part of human rights organizations against child labor, looking over the well-being of their people.
