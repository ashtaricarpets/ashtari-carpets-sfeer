They are imperfectly perfect. Each unique and unpredictable. With their authentic design, they connect spaces and people, creating room for togetherness. Meet the new Kilim Rugs Collection designed in collaboration with Belgium-based and family-owned Ashtari Carpets. 

 *“Each yarn is hand-made on a traditional weaving loom and carefully selected to ensure that the individual finish and natural texture of each item are maximized,” says Reza Ashtari, co-founder of Ashtari carpets. All rugs in this new collection are hand-made in Pakistan by experienced artisans with knowledge that goes back more than 150 years. As such, each rug carries its own story with reference to the past of traditional craftsmanship and a transition to the future with timeless colors and patterns.*

The connection between past and present, craftsmanship and aesthetics, is only reinforced by durable locally sourced wool that contributes surprising nuances and color variations to the rugs. These irregularities originate from the natural wool pigment that beautifully wraps around the yarn, resulting in truly unique rugs suitable for any space in your home. 

The seven designs in this new collection comprise patterned and plain styles with some embracing characteristics found in nature. Each design perfectly blends with existing Ethnicraft pieces, such as chairs, sofas, tables, and beds, to create a harmonious space and atmosphere where elegant simplicity, warmth, and comfort are central.
