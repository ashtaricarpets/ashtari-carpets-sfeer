To enhance your Antwerp Design Week experience, we prioritize convenience.

Antwerp Design Week connects not only top design companies but also the beautiful city of Antwerp with its best restaurants and shops. Visitors can stroll through the city between showroom visits and fully experience what Antwerp Design Week has to offer.

## Considering transportation options?
If you're planning to explore districts North, East, South, or West, bringing your car or renting one (1) would be convenient, as parking is readily available in front of showrooms.
However, in bustling downtown areas, we suggest opting for a Velo bike (2) for easier maneuverability. Leave your car at the hotel or a nearby garage for hassle-free exploration.
If you prefer not to drive yourself, we offer complimentary pre-booked shuttles, on-demand taxi services, or discounted rates for Get Driven, a platform providing private chauffeurs.
Simply visit 'The Club' for assistance in arranging your transportation, or utilize our user-friendly website or mobile app to book your preferred mode of transport.
(1) Discover our partnership with Hertz to get lowered prices on rental cars.
(2) Pick up your free vouchers for Velo-bikes at â€˜The Club

## Navigation
Discover the 5 districts: Downtown, North, East, South, and West.
Locate districts on our map and find brand details on our website or app. For smooth visits, we recommend exploring one district at a time. Use our mobile app as your tour guide and simply find all locations on 1 map or per district.

## HUBS
Antwerp Design Week revolves around the HUBS, locations where brands with headquarters in and around Antwerp generously host other brands that may not have a presence in the city. This unique setup fosters a dynamic exchange of diverse design ideas. Visitors have the opportunity to connect with a variety of brands, build meaningful connections, and explore potential collaborations.
