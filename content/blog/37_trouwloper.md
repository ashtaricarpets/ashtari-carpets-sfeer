Ashtari Carpets produced a beautiful wedding runner for the wedding room in the Antwerp City Hall of no less than 13.5 meters long.

It is a combination of natural wool combined with nettle. The yellow lines throughout the design ensure that the carpet integrates perfectly in the wedding room. The beautiful light makes everyone dream away...

The rug project of the City Hall hall has a total of 7 hand-knotted rugs produced by Ashtari Carpets and designed by Studio Lommer and Jente Hendrickx. At the reopening of the City Hall, after a long renovation, the weddingrunner can be admired.
