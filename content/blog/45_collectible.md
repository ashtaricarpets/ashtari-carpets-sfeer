## Collaboration between Caporusso x Ashtari

Renowned designer Sebastien Caporusso and Ashtari Carpets join forces driven by mutual admiration. Ashtari finds inspiration in Sebastien's exquisite creations, while Sebastien's fascination with hand-knotted carpets ignites their shared vision.

## Together, they bring to life two remarkable designs: Path and Moon.

Sebastien contributes his unique designs, while Wendy Guns plays a pivotal role in overseeing the entire carpet production process, ensuring meticulous attention to detail from inception to completion. The result is truly impressive – two exceptionally distinct designs that we eagerly anticipate unveiling at the upcoming Collectible design fair: Path and Moon.

## Collectible

Experimental in its approach, COLLECTIBLE is a one-of-a-kind platform for the showcase and discovery of the best in contemporary collectible design. Seeking to continuously push the boundaries of creativity, the fair brings together established and emerging galleries, design studios, independent makers and brands in a dynamic integrated space, while collaborating with leading curators, design institutions and foundations to deliver groundbreaking commissions and curated projects.

Focused on today’s creation, COLLECTIBLE strives to only showcase high-quality and well-researched objects which reflect the latest currents. In order to keep COLLECTIBLE's concept coherent, works presented are either unique pieces, bespoke commissions or limited editions, pieces are functional or have functionality in mind during the process and all works need to have been produced recently, while premieres are favoured.

As the sole fair exclusively dedicated to contemporary collectible design, COLLECTIBLE is returning to its original venue, the Vanderborght building, for its 7th edition. The event is scheduled to take place from Thursday, March 7th to Sunday, March 10th, 2024, with a VIP preview on Wednesday, March 6th, 2024, in Brussels.
