## 9 days, 10 designers & more than 70 suppliers

> ‘Gert Voorjans’ exhilarating environments reflect the singular audacity of his vision.

> His unexpected juxtapositions of beautiful, surprising, provoking, and unique objects, works of art, and sculptural furniture elements constantly challenge the way we think about how we live today.

> There is no place for timid, mundane or formulaic in his design vocabulary, instead Gert’s brilliantly coloured world celebrates the daring and the exceptional.

> His magical roomscapes ignite our imaginations, fuel our dreams, and enhance our realities. These are exciting rooms for thoughtful people.’
