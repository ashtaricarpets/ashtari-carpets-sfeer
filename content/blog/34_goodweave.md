Ashtari Carpets is a very proud partner of Goodweave International. Our Rugs will carry the label of Goodweave.
The GoodWeave label means that no child, forced or bonded labor was used in the making of a certified product, and that your purchase supports programs that educate children and ensure decent work for adults. Here’s how it works.

### Label Criteria
Licensed producers must meet the requirements of the GoodWeave Standard–a standard rooted in three unwavering principles:

- No child labor is allowed
- No forced or bonded labor is allowed
- Workplace conditions are documented and verifiable

GoodWeave makes regular, unannounced inspections of all production facilities that cover tier one factories and all outsourced production, including homes, to verify compliance with this Standard. These producers also undergo a separate annual audit to document their performance against the Standard’s following progress principles:

- Freedom of association and collective bargaining are recognized
- No discrimination is practiced
- Decent working conditions are respected, including workplace safety and health, wages, working hours, and disciplinary practices
- Negative environmental impacts of production are identified and minimized

### Label Issuance
GoodWeave certification labels are issued to licensed producers selling products to licensed importers.

- Only licensed producers can use the GoodWeave label
- Producers must first be approved by GoodWeave’s Certification Committee in order to be licensed and use the label
- Licensed producers and their subcontractors must comply with the GoodWeave Standard
- The Certification Committee reviews all cases of noncompliance
 

### Credibility
Meaningful labels help guide informed purchasing decisions. Use the following criteria when evaluating any label claim:

- The claim is clear and free from misleading details
- It is based on substantiated evidence
- Its system is transparent  and information about the claim is freely available and accessible
- There are significant controls as to how the label is issued and used

GoodWeave is ISEAL Code Compliant. Our system has been independently evaluated against ISEAL’s Codes of Good Practice – a globally- recognized framework for effective, credible sustainability systems.

GoodWeave is independently assessed against the ISO/IEC 17065 standard, which ensures that the organization is free of external pressure, is transparent, has quality control, and producers are treated equally.
